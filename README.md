# Python Crawlee & BeautifulSoup Actor Template

<!-- This is an Apify template readme -->

This template example was built with [Crawlee for Python](https://crawlee.dev/python) to scrape data from a website using [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) wrapped into [BeautifulSoupCrawler](https://crawlee.dev/python/api/class/BeautifulSoupCrawler).

## Quick Start

Once you've installed the dependencies, start the Actor:

```bash
apify run
```

Once your Actor is ready, you can push it to the Apify Console:

```bash
apify login # first, you need to log in if you haven't already done so

apify push
```

## Project Structure

For more information, see the [Actor definition](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-definition) documentation.

## How it works

This code is a Python script that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape data from a website. It then stores the website titles in a dataset.

- The crawler starts with URLs provided from the input `startUrls` field defined by the input schema. Number of scraped pages is limited by `maxPagesPerCrawl` field from the input schema.
- The crawler uses `requestHandler` for each URL to extract the data from the page with the BeautifulSoup library and to save the title and URL of each page to the dataset. It also logs out each result that is being saved.

## What's included

- **[Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/)** - toolkit for building [Actors](https://apify.com/actors)
- **[Crawlee for Python](https://crawlee.dev/python/)** - web scraping and browser automation library
- **[Input schema](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/input-schema)** - define and easily validate a schema for your Actor's input
- **[Dataset](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/docs/concepts/storages#working-with-datasets)** - store structured data where each object stored has the same attributes
- **[Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)** - a library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files
- **[Proxy configuration](https://docs.apify.com/platform/proxy)** - rotate IP addresses to prevent blocking

## Creating Actors with templates

[How to create Apify Actors with web scraping code templates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-i-Korzf8w)


## Getting started

For complete information [see this article](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development#build-actor-at-apify-console). In short, you will:

1. Build the Actor
2. Run the Actor

## Pull the Actor for local development

If you would like to develop locally, you can pull the existing Actor from Apify console using Apify CLI:

1. Install `apify-cli`

    **Using Homebrew**

    ```bash
    brew install apify-cli
    ```

    **Using NPM**

    ```bash
    npm -g install apify-cli
    ```

2. Pull the Actor by its unique `<ActorId>`, which is one of the following:
    - unique name of the Actor to pull (e.g. "apify/hello-world")
    - or ID of the Actor to pull (e.g. "E2jjCZBezvAZnX8Rb")

    You can find both by clicking on the Actor title at the top of the page, which will open a modal containing both Actor unique name and Actor ID.

    This command will copy the Actor into the current directory on your local machine.

    ```bash
    apify pull <ActorId>
    ```
